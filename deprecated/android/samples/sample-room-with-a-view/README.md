================

This repository contains the finished sample code for the
[Architecture Components codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/android-room-with-a-view/index.html?index=..%2F..%2Findex#0) in Java on the master branch and in Kotlin for the [Architecture Components Kotlin codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/android-room-with-a-view-kotlin) on the [kotlin](https://github.com/googlecodelabs/android-room-with-a-view/tree/kotlin) branch.

Introduction
------------

In May 2017 Google released the Architecture Components libraries.
Each library manages and simplifies aspects of data persistence and the
UI component lifecycle. Together, the libraries encourage a modular
app architecture that results in reduced complexity and less code.

This sample shows how to use the libraries to build
a complete basic app that implements the recommended architecture
and can be used as a template for further explorations.


Pre-requisites
--------------

* Android Studio 3.0 or later and you know how to use it.

* Make sure Android Studio is updated, as well as your SDK and Gradle.
Otherwise, you may have to wait for a while until all the updates are done.

* A device or emulator that runs API level 26

You need to be solidly familiar with the Java programming language,
object-oriented design concepts, and Android Development Fundamentals.
In particular:

* RecyclerView and Adapters
* SQLite database and the SQLite query language
* Threading and AsyncTask
* It helps to be familiar with software architectural patterns that separate
  data from the user interface, such as MVP or MVC. This codelab implements the
  architecture defined in the
  [Guide to App Architecture](
  https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/guide.html)

Getting Started
---------------

1. [Install Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/install.html),
if you don't already have it.
2. Download the sample.
2. Import the sample into Android Studio.
3. Build and run the sample.
