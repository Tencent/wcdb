 @brief close the database.
        Since Multi-threaded operation is supported in WCDB, other operations in different thread can open the closed database. So this method can make sure database is closed in the "onClosed" block. All other operations will be blocked until this method returns.
        A close operation consists of 4 steps:
            1. blockade, which blocks all other operations.
            2. close, which waits until all sqlite handles return and closes them.
            3. onClosed, which trigger the callback.
            4. unblokade, which unblocks all other opreations.
        You can simply call close: to do all steps above or call these separately.
        Since this method will wait until all sqlite handles return, it may lead to deadlock in some bad practice. The key to avoid deadlock is to make sure all WCDB objects in current thread is dealloced. In detail:
            1. You should not keep WCDB objects, including WCTInsert, WCTDelete, WCTUpdate, WCTSelect, WCTRowSelect, WCTMultiSelect, WCTStatement, WCTTransaction. These objects should not be kept. You should get them, use them, then release them(set to nil) right away.
            2. WCDB objects may not be out of its' scope.
            3. Further more, those WCDB objects may be kept by NSAutoReleasePool, which is done by ARC automatically. So you should make sure that all WCDB objects in NSAutoReleasePool is drained. 
            The best practice is to call close: in sub-thread and display a loading animation in main thread.
 
     //close directly
     [database close:^(){
        //do something on this closed database
     }];
