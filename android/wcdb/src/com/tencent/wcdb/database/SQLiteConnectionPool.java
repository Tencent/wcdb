/**
 * Maintains a pool of active SQLite database connections.
 * <p>
 * At any given time, a connection is either owned by the pool, or it has been
 * acquired by a {@link SQLiteSession}.  When the {@link SQLiteSession} is
 * finished with the connection it is using, it must return the connection
 * back to the pool.
 * </p><p>
 * The pool holds strong references to the connections it owns.  However,
 * it only holds <em>weak references</em> to the connections that sessions
 * have acquired from it.  Using weak references in the latter case ensures
 * that the connection pool can detect when connections have been improperly
 * abandoned so that it can create new connections to replace them if needed.
 * </p><p>
 * The connection pool is thread-safe (but the connections themselves are not).
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Exception safety</h2>
 * <p>
 * This code attempts to maintain the invariant that opened connections are
 * always owned.  Unfortunately that means it needs to handle exceptions
 * all over to ensure that broken connections get cleaned up.  Most
 * operations invokving SQLite can throw {@link SQLiteException} or other
 * runtime exceptions.  This is a bit of a pain to deal with because the compiler
 * cannot help us catch missing exception handling code.
 * </p><p>
 * The general rule for this file: If we are making calls out to
 * {@link SQLiteConnection} then we must be prepared to handle any
 * runtime exceptions it might throw at us.  Note that out-of-memory
 * is an {@link Error}, not a {@link RuntimeException}.  We don't trouble ourselves
 * handling out of memory because it is hard to do anything at all sensible then
 * and most likely the VM is about to crash.
 * </p>
