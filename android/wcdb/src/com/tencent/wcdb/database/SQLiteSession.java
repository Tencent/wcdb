/**
 * Provides a single client the ability to use a database.
 * <p/>
 * <h2>About database sessions</h2>
 * <p>
 * Database access is always performed using a session.  The session
 * manages the lifecycle of transactions and database connections.
 * </p><p>
 * Sessions can be used to perform both read-only and read-write operations.
 * There is some advantage to knowing when a session is being used for
 * read-only purposes because the connection pool can optimize the use
 * of the available connections to permit multiple read-only operations
 * to execute in parallel whereas read-write operations may need to be serialized.
 * </p><p>
 * When <em>Write Ahead Logging (WAL)</em> is enabled, the database can
 * execute simultaneous read-only and read-write transactions, provided that
 * at most one read-write transaction is performed at a time.  When WAL is not
 * enabled, read-only transactions can execute in parallel but read-write
 * transactions are mutually exclusive.
 * </p>
 * <p/>
 * <h2>Ownership and concurrency guarantees</h2>
 * <p>
 * Session objects are not thread-safe.  In fact, session objects are thread-bound.
 * The {@link SQLiteDatabase} uses a thread-local variable to associate a session
 * with each thread for the use of that thread alone.  Consequently, each thread
 * has its own session object and therefore its own transaction state independent
 * of other threads.
 * </p><p>
 * A thread has at most one session per database.  This constraint ensures that
 * a thread can never use more than one database connection at a time for a
 * given database.  As the number of available database connections is limited,
 * if a single thread tried to acquire multiple connections for the same database
 * at the same time, it might deadlock.  Therefore we allow there to be only
 * one session (so, at most one connection) per thread per database.
 * </p>
 * <p/>
 * <h2>Transactions</h2>
 * <p>
 * There are two kinds of transaction: implicit transactions and explicit
 * transactions.
 * </p><p>
 * An implicit transaction is created whenever a database operation is requested
 * and there is no explicit transaction currently in progress.  An implicit transaction
 * only lasts for the duration of the database operation in question and then it
 * is ended.  If the database operation was successful, then its changes are committed.
 * </p><p>
 * An explicit transaction is started by calling {@link #beginTransaction} and
 * specifying the desired transaction mode.  Once an explicit transaction has begun,
 * all subsequent database operations will be performed as part of that transaction.
 * To end an explicit transaction, first call {@link #setTransactionSuccessful} if the
 * transaction was successful, then call {@link #endTransaction}.  If the transaction was
 * marked successful, its changes will be committed, otherwise they will be rolled back.
 * </p><p>
 * Explicit transactions can also be nested.  A nested explicit transaction is
 * started with {@link #beginTransaction}, marked successful with
 * {@link #setTransactionSuccessful}and ended with {@link #endTransaction}.
 * If any nested transaction is not marked successful, then the entire transaction
 * including all of its nested transactions will be rolled back
 * when the outermost transaction is ended.
 * </p><p>
 * To improve concurrency, an explicit transaction can be yielded by calling
 * {@link #yieldTransaction}.  If there is contention for use of the database,
 * then yielding ends the current transaction, commits its changes, releases the
 * database connection for use by another session for a little while, and starts a
 * new transaction with the same properties as the original one.
 * Changes committed by {@link #yieldTransaction} cannot be rolled back.
 * </p><p>
 * When a transaction is started, the client can provide a {@link SQLiteTransactionListener}
 * to listen for notifications of transaction-related events.
 * </p><p>
 * Recommended usage:
 * <code><pre>
 * // First, begin the transaction.
 * session.beginTransaction(SQLiteSession.TRANSACTION_MODE_DEFERRED, 0);
 * try {
 *     // Then do stuff...
 *     session.execute("INSERT INTO ...", null, 0);
 * <p/>
 *     // As the very last step before ending the transaction, mark it successful.
 *     session.setTransactionSuccessful();
 * } finally {
 *     // Finally, end the transaction.
 *     // This statement will commit the transaction if it was marked successful or
 *     // roll it back otherwise.
 *     session.endTransaction();
 * }
 * </pre></code>
 * </p>
 * <p/>
 * <h2>Database connections</h2>
 * <p>
 * A {@link SQLiteDatabase} can have multiple active sessions at the same
 * time.  Each session acquires and releases connections to the database
 * as needed to perform each requested database transaction.  If all connections
 * are in use, then database transactions on some sessions will block until a
 * connection becomes available.
 * </p><p>
 * The session acquires a single database connection only for the duration
 * of a single (implicit or explicit) database transaction, then releases it.
 * This characteristic allows a small pool of database connections to be shared
 * efficiently by multiple sessions as long as they are not all trying to perform
 * database transactions at the same time.
 * </p>
 * <p/>
 * <h2>Responsiveness</h2>
 * <p>
 * Because there are a limited number of database connections and the session holds
 * a database connection for the entire duration of a database transaction,
 * it is important to keep transactions short.  This is especially important
 * for read-write transactions since they may block other transactions
 * from executing.  Consider calling {@link #yieldTransaction} periodically
 * during long-running transactions.
 * </p><p>
 * Another important consideration is that transactions that take too long to
 * run may cause the application UI to become unresponsive.  Even if the transaction
 * is executed in a background thread, the user will get bored and
 * frustrated if the application shows no data for several seconds while
 * a transaction runs.
 * </p><p>
 * Guidelines:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Do not perform database transactions on the UI thread.</li>
 * <li>Keep database transactions as short as possible.</li>
 * <li>Simple queries often run faster than complex queries.</li>
 * <li>Measure the performance of your database transactions.</li>
 * <li>Consider what will happen when the size of the data set grows.
 * A query that works well on 100 rows may struggle with 10,000.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p/>
 * <h2>Reentrance</h2>
 * <p>
 * This class must tolerate reentrant execution of SQLite operations because
 * triggers may call custom SQLite functions that perform additional queries.
