 * When obtaining a database handle, you can indicate whether
 * this handle will be used to write new data to the database.
 *
 * The handle counter is used to limit the number of handles in two ways:
 * 1. Only 4 handles can exist for writing at the same time.
 *    Because it is difficult to accurately distinguish whether the handle is used for writing,
 *    and there is still a little time between getting the handle and writing data,
 *    let the four handles fully compete.
 * 2. Only up to 32 handles can exist at the same time.
 *    Too many handles not only take up memory, but generally imply inappropriate usage.
 *
 * When the number limit is exceeded, the handle counter will let the thread
 * that acquires the handle wait in place until other handles are recycled.
